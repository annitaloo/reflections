When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to have a remote back-up. When I want to share my work. When I want to collaborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe sometimes we don’t want to pull the changes…
